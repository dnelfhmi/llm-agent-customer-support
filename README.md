## üöÄ Smart Support Agent: Autonomous Ticket Workflow with OpenAI GPT, LangGraph, FastAPI, SQLite and PineCone

A repository for documenting the development of agentic LLM customer support.
An autonomous agentic support ticket workflow built with OpenAI GPT model, FastAPI, LangGraph, and Pinecone.

-----

### ü§ñ What is this project?

This agentic customer support system uses OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` as its reasoning engine ("brain") and `text-embedding-ada-002` for semantic search, combined with Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval. The system also features persistent agent memory, stored in a local SQLite database, allowing it to maintain and recall conversation context and ticket history across interactions for more coherent and context-aware support responses.

It shows how to build an LLM-powered support agent that:

	‚Ä¢	Understands incoming tickets
	‚Ä¢	Retrieves relevant policy knowledge dynamically
	‚Ä¢	Uses real-time tools (like courier tracking)
	‚Ä¢	Keeps conversation memory
	‚Ä¢	Plans actions autonomously (auto-reply, escalate, or human review)
	‚Ä¢	Executes routing, all in Python with LangGraph, Pinecone, and FastAPI.

-----

### üõ†Ô∏è How does it work?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Receive:
A FastAPI Webhook receives tickets.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Understand & Retrieve:
The agent:

	‚Ä¢	Generates embeddings for the ticket text.
	‚Ä¢	Queries Pinecone for relevant KB snippets.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally calls Courier Tracking API for live status.
	‚Ä¢	Pulls conversation Memory for context.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Plan Next Best Action:
Using LangGraph, the agent reasons:

	‚Ä¢	Should we auto-reply?
	‚Ä¢	Is this high urgency ‚Äî escalate to manager?
	‚Ä¢	Or send for human review?

It outputs structured JSON only.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Route & Act:
The server routes the action:

	‚Ä¢	Auto-replies with KB snippets.
	‚Ä¢	Notifies manager via Slack/Email.
	‚Ä¢	Or pauses for human review.

Every step is logged for traceability and future fine-tuning.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key-here
   ```
   **Do NOT commit your `.env` file to git.**

3. POST via /tickets endpoints.
