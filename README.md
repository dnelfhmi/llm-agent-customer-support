## üöÄ Smart Support Agent ‚Äî Autonomous Ticket Workflow with LangGraph & FastAPI

A repository for documenting the development of agentic LLM customer support.
An autonomous agentic support ticket workflow built with FastAPI, LangGraph, and Pinecone.

-----

### ü§ñ What is this project?

This is an agentic customer support ticket system built from scratch (no low-code tools like n8n).
It shows how to build an LLM-powered support agent that:

	‚Ä¢	Understands incoming tickets
	‚Ä¢	Retrieves relevant policy knowledge dynamically
	‚Ä¢	Uses real-time tools (like courier tracking)
	‚Ä¢	Keeps conversation memory
	‚Ä¢	Plans actions autonomously (auto-reply, escalate, or human review)
	‚Ä¢	Executes routing ‚Äî all in Python with LangGraph, Pinecone, and FastAPI.

-----

### üõ†Ô∏è How does it work?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Receive:
A FastAPI Webhook receives tickets.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Understand & Retrieve:
The agent:

	‚Ä¢	Generates embeddings for the ticket text.
	‚Ä¢	Queries Pinecone for relevant KB snippets.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally calls Courier Tracking API for live status.
	‚Ä¢	Pulls conversation Memory for context.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Plan Next Best Action:
Using LangGraph, the agent reasons:

	‚Ä¢	Should we auto-reply?
	‚Ä¢	Is this high urgency ‚Äî escalate to manager?
	‚Ä¢	Or send for human review?

It outputs structured JSON only.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Route & Act:
The server routes the action:

	‚Ä¢	Auto-replies with KB snippets.
	‚Ä¢	Notifies manager via Slack/Email.
	‚Ä¢	Or pauses for human review.

Every step is logged for traceability and future fine-tuning.

‚ö†Ô∏è Generating embedding and retrieving knowledge base for similarity search

‚ö†Ô∏è Action routing based on LLM agent suggestion

‚ö†Ô∏è UI for easy usage and navigation

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   ```
   **Do NOT commit your `.env` file to git.**

3. POST via /tickets endpoints.
